        <h1 id="daily-tasks">Daily Tasks</h1>
<p>Routine is at the heart of productivity for me, so I created this as a way of enforcing it. If I leave it up to me, I struggle to do things like keep a journal, because often my it's hard to bring my attention away from what is right in front of me. This makes the habit easier to start and maintain.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Right now all this does is launches a few journals that I intend to keep daily through VS Code at specified times using systemd timers.</p>
<p>I used VS Code instead of Atom because of the command line interface</p>
<p>I used Systemd instead of Chron because I need to get better with it for some projects automating webscraping. slicing is super useful for resource management.</p>
<p>I recently removed Tagging from both the dream journal and the evening journal, because tagging should be something that is automated. The way I look at it it's metadata, which is something I should be less concerned about directly. It's useful for analysis, but trying to write it manually is both cumbersome and error-prone.</p>
<p>I removed weather, and places visited from the evening journal for similar reasons. it's metadata, and should be tracked by other methods.</p>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<p>Find a way to syncronize between two computers with zero/extremely minimal data loss(empty file overwriting filled file, or a file getting filled with junk), planning on using drive</p>
<p>Implement some kind of tagging system</p>
<p>Build a scraper for weather data, while not related to the daily task, it is something that I feel should be used in within the larger context of self-tracking</p>
<p>perhaps build a relational database around keeping this and other self-tracking data organized.</p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p>If you use systemd all you need to do after downloading this repository is run the populate script with sudo permissions.</p>
